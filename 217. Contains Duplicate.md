### Introduction

This document analyzes a LeetCode problem that tests the ability to determine if an array contains any duplicates. The core challenge is efficiently identifying repeat occurrences within the array.

### Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, the goal is to return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and `false` if every element is distinct.

### Solution Overview (Design)

The solution employs a set to track unique elements, leveraging the property that a set cannot contain duplicate items to detect duplicates in the array.

### Algorithm Analysis (Analysis)

The time complexity is O(n) due to the traversal of each element in the array once, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing elements in a set.

### Techniques Used

- **Data Structure:** Set, for its ability to store unique elements and provide efficient lookups.
- **Algorithmic Paradigm:** Hashing, to quickly access and insert elements with constant time complexity on average.
