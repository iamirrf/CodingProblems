### Introduction
This document provides an analysis of a specific problem commonly found in technical interviews and coding challenge platforms such as LeetCode: determining if there are two numbers within an array that add up to a given target. This problem assesses the candidate's skills in array manipulation, efficient search techniques, and understanding of data structures for optimized problem-solving.

### Problem Description
The task is to implement a function that takes an array of integers (`nums`) and an integer (`target`). The goal is to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. The conditions specify that each input will have exactly one solution, and an element cannot be used more than once.

### Solution Overview (Design)
The solution adopts a hash map (dictionary in Python) to maintain a mapping from the elements of the array to their indices. This approach enables constant average time complexity for lookups, thereby allowing for efficient identification of the complement for any given element in the array.

- **Initialization**: A dictionary named `num_map` is initialized to store elements as keys and their indices as values.
- **Iteration and Lookup**: The function iterates over `nums`, for each element calculating the complement needed to reach the `target`. It then checks if this complement is already in `num_map`.
- **Return Indices**: If a complement is found, the function immediately returns a list containing the current element's index and the complement's index from `num_map`.
- **Update Dictionary**: If no complement is found, the current element and its index are added to `num_map` for potential future matches.

### Algorithm Analysis (Analysis)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as the solution requires a single pass through the array, with each operation in the hash map (insertion and lookup) having an average time complexity of O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), because in the worst case, the hash map might need to store information for each element in the array, requiring space proportional to the array's size.

### Techniques Used
- **Data Structure**: Hash Map, leveraged for its efficient support of quick lookup and insertion operations.
- **Algorithmic Paradigm**: Hashing, which enables direct indexing based on element values, facilitates the rapid identification of pair elements that satisfy the sum condition.
